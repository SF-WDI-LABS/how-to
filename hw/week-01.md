# Week 1

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

1. Complete the fundamentals check-in. This should help you review some important topics from fundamentals and give us a better idea of what to review with the class or individuals:

)

1. Watch [Growth Mindset TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc) and think about how you can apply a growth mindset to your life as a developer!



### Tuesday
**Link to turn in on Wednesday's pulse check survey**: Your control flow training repository.

1. Complete this afternoon's [control flow training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/js-control-flow-training/), "Security Questions" and "Sing" sections.  

  **DUE** -- turn in your work on the control flow exercises on Wednesday using the [homework submission instructions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/schedule/blob/master/how-to/submit-hw.md).

2. Complete the [More Complex Structures section](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/js-data-types-training#more-complex-structures) of this afternoon's data types training. **Check your answers as you go!** Time cap yourself to 20, minutes and then work through any solutions you did not reach within that time.
2. Read ahead: skim through [tomorrow's functions module](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/js-functions).

Bonus: If you have time, work on the [site recreation training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/site-recreation) from this morning's HTML and CSS lesson.



### Wednesday
**Link to turn in on Thursday's pulse check survey**: Your functions repository.

1. Complete the deliverables from this morning's [functions training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/functions-training).  

  **DUE** -- turn in your work on these exercises on Thursday using the [homework submission instructions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/schedule/blob/master/how-to/submit-hw.md).

2. Keep working on your [personal portfolio site](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/personal-portfolio#deliverables) to get the basic structure and style created with HTML and CSS. (You can try adding JavaScript DOM manipulation now or wait until after we go over it on Thursday.) We will be having a show and tell on **Friday morning**.

2. Read ahead: tommorow, we'll start looking at a JavaScript library called jQuery.  Skim through tomorrow's [DOM Manipulation](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/dom-manipulation) and [DOM Events](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/dom-events-jquery) notes. jQuery adds shorter ways to write things, in comparison to regular JavaScript. Focus on recollecting what you can do with JavaScript and on getting a feel for jQuery syntax.


### Thursday
**Link to turn in on Friday's pulse check survey**: Your personal portfolio repository.

1. Prepare your personal portfolio site for show and tell tomorrow!
2. Finish the [jQuery events afternoon training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/jquery-events-training).
3. Fork [this list of weekly objectives](https://gist.github.com/cofauver/de116e2e030004fdf17ef3f8a43952b3). Once you've forked it, you'll be able to check off the boxes and keep your own tally of the objectives and how you're feeling about your progress. **Note:** we'll be covering Bootstrap tomorrow, so you'll see Bootstrap objectives on the checklist, but we won't have covered them.
4. Review this week's material: come in tomorrow with two specific questions you had from reviewing the objectives and the material for the week.
