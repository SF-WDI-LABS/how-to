1. Read through the [project 3 specification document](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-03). Planning deliverables are due Wednesday, so you should already be thinking about what you want to build and what technologies you will use. Use this document to help you.

1. To help prepare for tomorrow, research React.  Read and interact with [React's home page](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Edit the code snippets on the left to see the code output change in the boxes on the right. As an additional resource, check out [videos of React talks over the years](https://facebook.github.io/react/community/videos.html). The first video on that page is the initial React announcement in 2013.
