# Week 2

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

**Link to turn in on Tuesday's pulse check survey**: Your JavaScript objects training repository.

1. Complete or spend 3 hours on [the objects training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/js-objects-training) from this afternoon. Make sure to CHECK [THE SOLUTIONS](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/js-objects-training/tree/solutions/challenges) after you wrap up your work with each.  

   **DUE** -- turn in your work on these exercises on Tuesday using the [homework submission instructions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/schedule/blob/master/how-to/submit-hw.md) and the pulse check form.

1. Read ahead: tommorow, we'll gather user input in forms, and we'll interact with data from other sites through AJAX. Take a look at these notes on [HTML Forms](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/html-forms) and [AJAX](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/ajax).  

1. Optional: If you'd like an extra challenge and extra practice with `for` loops and callbacks, you could try [writing your own iterator methods](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/building-js-iterators-lab/). If you'd like to try these exercises, we suggest looking at the solution for one, since we didn't get to go over this in class.


### Tuesday

1. Complete the afternoon [giffaw lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/giffaw).
