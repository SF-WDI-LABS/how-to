# Week 8

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.



### Monday

Link to include on Monday's pulse check: the second run of your Library app.

1. Complete the base portion (not bonuses) of the [Asset Pipeline Poem training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/asset-pipeline-poem) so that you see the poem in order with the metadata. Then, complete the ["Displaying Images" section of the asset pipeline poem "Take it Further" from this afternoon's exercises](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/rails-asset-pipeline/blob/master/exercises.md#displaying-images). Feel free to try bonuses or the other "Take it Further" exercise if you'd like. 

1. Review rspec by doing part of [this Rspec Racer training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/rspec-racer).  Please fork and clone that repository and finish writing the tests for at least the `Car` class.  When you run `rspec spec/car_spec.rb`, you should see all the tests you wrote (at least 3 tests) passing. Feel free to do more if you'd like.
