# Week 4B

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Tuesday

Wrap up Project 1. Review the deliverables and requirements.  You will not have time to make changes tomorrow. Don't forget to write your readme and plan what each partner will talk about during the presentation!



### Wednesday

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/schedule/blob/master/how-to/submit-an-issue.md) on your team's project 1 repository that either covers a bug your team identified or ideas for how to implement a feature you wanted to add.

2. Fill out the [Project 1 Peer Feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/h0PFGPNlBsAPcnaS2) to reflect on your team's work in this project. Your answers will be combined with outside observations of your group as part of project feedback (not shared directly with your partner). Please be honest and fair - this is your way to help your partner improve!

3. Read [the Angular Developer's Guide introduction to angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction) with these questions in mind:
  * What problems is Angular aiming to address?
  * What terminology is unfamiliar?
  * What questions do you have entering into using Angular?

5. In the [Intro Angular Challenges](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/intro_angular_challenges) lab, do challenge 1 and at least exercise 1 of challenge 2.  As you work, write down answers to the following questions:

 * What syntax does angular use for client-side templating?
 * How would you describe two-way data binding to someone who had never used angular?
 * What do you think a controller is?  A module?
 * Where do you think angular might be using DOM events behind the scenes?

### Thursday

1. Finish the "instructions" portion of Tune.ly Angular sprints 1 and 2. Give yourself a time limit for trying to get each sprint working independently (maybe 30 minutes). After that time, work through the solutions for the sprint you're on.   

  > Angular debugging protip: triple-check that you've done every step and spelled everything correctly; there are a lot of variable names and strings that *must* match between your JavaScript and HTML.

  > **As an additional resource**, you can check out [Code School's AngularJS Tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js).

1. Based on your work with Tunely's first two sprints, plan or pseudocode delete functionality.  Decide at least the following questions:
  - Where would you add a delete button?
  - How would you make it so the delete button triggered an AJAX request?
  - What would you change about the AJAX request?
  - What would you do after a successful response?

1. To review today's intro to the `$http` service and to prepare for tomorrow's lessons on update and delete, read [the `$http` service documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http). Specifically, look at the **General Usage**, **Usage**, and **Examples** sections. The **Shortcut Methods** and **Methods** sections may also interest you, although we won't be using those methods in our example code.

### Weekend

1. Complete the [Angular Books App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/angular-books-crud-lab)! When you finish work on the books app:

  * add a 3-5 sentence summary of how the training went for you to the top of the README on your master branch,
  * add a link to the class repo at the top of the README on your master branch, and
  * push your changes to GitHub.

1. Go back over the Angular apps we've seen so far.  Try to write down **all** the steps you would take to create an Angular app from scratch.  Create a PUBLIC GitHub [gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) that lists all your steps, and link it in the My Work section of your personal website (communicating about technology is an important skill!).  Here's a [quick gist create link](https://gist.github.com/). Include tips or explanations for the code you suggest developers write.

<!-- 1. Review the learning objectives from this week, and write down at least one question about the material.  Bring your written question to GA tomorrow! -->
