1. Work on coding breadth first tree search with exercise 3 from the [breadth first lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/breadth-first-search).  Spend up to 20 minutes working on filling in the breadth first search function from the JS or Ruby starter code, then look over the solutions. 

1. Work on coding depth-first tree search with exercise 3 from the [depth first lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/depth-first-search).  Spend up to 20 minutes working on filling in the breadth first search function from the JS or Ruby starter code, then look over the solutions. 

1. For tomorrow, read and study chapter 1 and 2 of the Rails guide on [using Rails for API-only applications](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html).  You don't have to fully understand all of the things chapter 2 is describing, but investigate one new thing you didn't know Rails did. This should take about 30-60 minutes. 

1. For tomorrow, review the intro to angular notes (especially the section about ["setting up an angular app"](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/intro-angular#setting-up-an-angular-app)) and/or your Angular setup gist. Also, review the syntax for `$http`.  This should take about 30-60 minutes.
