1. Work on coding breadth first tree search with exercise 3 from the [breadth first lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/breadth-first-search).  Spend up to 20 minutes working on filling in the breadth first search function from the JS or Ruby starter code, then look over the solutions.

1. Work on coding depth-first tree search with exercise 3 from the [depth first lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/depth-first-search).  Spend up to 20 minutes working on filling in the breadth first search function from the JS or Ruby starter code, then look over the solutions.

1. For tomorrow, read and study chapter 1 and 2 of the Rails guide on [using Rails for API-only applications](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html).  You don't have to fully understand all of the things chapter 2 is describing, but investigate one new thing you didn't know Rails did. This should take about 30-60 minutes.

1. For tomorrow, review the intro to angular notes (especially the section about ["setting up an angular app"](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/intro-angular#setting-up-an-angular-app)) and/or your Angular setup gist. Also, review the syntax for `$http`.  This should take about 30-60 minutes.

### Wednesday

1. Work on building out your todos Rangular application for an hour. Prioritize these tasks:
  * a working todos resource on the server side that serves as JSON.
  * `$http` call that gets all of the todos on the server side and displays them in the `home` view. Remember `ng-repeat`?
  When you've finished those, focus on create and delete on both the client side and the server side. On the client side, you might need to remember `ng-click` to listen for click events and bind those to a function.
2. Briefly (20-30 minutes) review [Mongo](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/mongoose), [Express](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express), and [Node](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express#what-is-node) materials in preparation for discussing the MEN stack and MEAN stack tomorrow. Write down any questions that come up while you review these materials.
3. Take ~30 minutes to look through the [Tunely solutions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/tunely/tree/34/solutions-sprint-6) and the [Tunely Angular solutions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/tunely-angular/tree/solutions_sprint_5) to investigate the similarities and differences between the MEN stack and the MEAN stack. Write down at least three observations about their similarities and differences.
