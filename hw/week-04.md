# Week 4

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.



### Monday

**link to submit on Tuesday night's pulse check: your GitHub repository for Tunely**

1. Continue work on Tunely. If you don't have a copy yet, fork the repository you and your partner worked on today. Try to finish sprint 2 OR spend two hours working on sprint 2, then review sprint 2 solutions. 

2. Brainstorm ideas for Project 1.  If you'd like, you can glance ahead at the [project 1 specs](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-1), but these are subject to change until we officially start the project.  Also, you will be working with a partner who has ideas of their own, so don't get too attached to any one possibility.

### Tuesday

**links to submit on Wednesday night's pulse check: your group's Trello and GitHub project**

1. Join [Trello](https://trello.com/briannaveenstra/recommend)!  Here's a [sample trello board](https://trello.com/b/k42peuus/tunely-sample-project-trello).

1. Complete the Project 1 planning objectives with your partner. Discuss how you will communicate over break:

  - Will your group all need to be present at the same time for some meetings (in person, though calls)? Which days and for how long?
  - How often will you check in through slack?
  - How will you let your partner know there is a new change for them to review, try out, and merge?
  - How will you decide what new tasks each person takes on when one task is finished?

  **Bring your planning deliverables and this extra break planning with you tomorrow.**
