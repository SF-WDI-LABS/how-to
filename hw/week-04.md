# Week 4

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.



### Monday

**link to submit on Tuesday night's pulse check: your GitHub repository for Tunely**

1. Continue work on Tunely. If you don't have a copy yet, fork the repository you and your partner worked on today. Try to finish sprint 2 OR spend two hours working on sprint 2, then review sprint 2 solutions. 

2. Brainstorm ideas for Project 1.  If you'd like, you can glance ahead at the [project 1 specs](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-1), but these are subject to change until we officially start the project.  Also, you will be working with a partner who has ideas of their own, so don't get too attached to any one possibility. 



### Tuesday

**links to submit on Wednesday night's pulse check: your group's Trello and GitHub project**

1. Join [Trello](https://trello.com/briannaveenstra/recommend)!  Here's a [sample trello board](https://trello.com/b/k42peuus/tunely-sample-project-trello).

1. Complete the Project 1 planning objectives with your partner. Discuss how you will communicate over break:

  - Will your group all need to be present at the same time for some meetings (in person, though calls)? Which days and for how long?
  - How often will you check in through slack?
  - How will you let your partner know there is a new change for them to review, try out, and merge?
  - How will you decide what new tasks each person takes on when one task is finished?

  **Bring your planning deliverables and this extra break planning with you tomorrow.**
  

  



### Winter Break

Our main goal over winter break is for you to keep a handle on the "immersive" nature of this course. Don't allow yourself to leave the course material untouched for many days in a row! There are 12 days between our last day of class in December and restarting in January. It would be good to work on *something* related to the course on 8 of the 12 days of our break for at least 2 hours. You can spend this work time on your project work, review, or independent work that you've chosen for the break.

1. Plan out how coding fits into your daily schedule over the next 12 days. Plan out the work that you're hoping to accomplish. Outside of your project pick TWO specific, measurable, achievable goals to complete during our time off. 

1. Add your instructors to your Trello board: @coryfauver and @briannaveenstra. 

1. Progress substantially on Project 1 with your partner.  You will present these very soon after break.
