# Week 4

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.



### Monday

1. Continue work on Tunely. Try to finish through Sprint 3. 

2. Brainstorm ideas for Project 1.  If you'd like, you can glance ahead at the [project 1 specs](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-1).  You will be working with a partner who has ideas of their own, so don't get too attached to any one possibility. 

<!--

### Tuesday

1. Join [Trello]()!

1. Complete the Project 1 planning objectives with your partner. Discuss how you will communicate over break:

  - Will you meet in person or through calls (so you both need to be present at the same time)? Which days and for how long?
  - How often will you check in through slack?
  - How will you let your partner know there is a new change for them to review, test, and merge?
  - How will you decide what new tasks each person takes on when one task is finished?

  **Bring your planning deliverables and this extra break planning with you tomorrow.**
  

  



### Winter Break

1. Complete Project 1 with your partner.  You will present these very soon after break.

1. Sign up for an account on [codewars.com](www.codewars.com/r/RxX5pA).  Choose JavaScript as your language, and join the "General Assembly" clan.
