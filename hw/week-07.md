# Week 7

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.



### Monday

**link to submit in Monday's pulse check:** your GitHub repo from the Rails getting started guide

1. Finish the steps to work through the conference speaker app from [this afternoon's training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/active-record).  Set a time limit to work on it yourself, then look through solutions. 

1. Read chapters 1-3 of the Rails Guide on [Action View Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html#templates-partials-and-layouts). Skip the section on XML (3.1.2). Write down 2 questions and 2 important term definitions you learned. 

1. Read chapters 1-2 of the Rails Guide on [Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html). Write down 2 questions and 2 important term definitions you learned. 



### Tuesday

**link to submit in Tuesday's pulse check:** your GitHub repo for the [conference speaker app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/active-record).

1. Finish the "Steps to Refactor" listed in the [Rails Views & Helpers training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/rails_views_helpers_training). Remember to refrence the external resources and the class glossary/cheatsheet. Set a time limit for each task to attempt it without looking at the solutions (maybe 20 minutes), then compare your approach to the solution and make sure you understand how to complete the task. 

1. If you haven't yet, create a GitHub repository for the aquarium app you made this afternoon. Finish "Independent Practice" from the afternoon's [Migrations workshop](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/migrations). Commit your app frequently, and push all of your changes to GitHub when you're done. 

1. Read Chapter 1 (Why Associations?) from the [Active Record Associations Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html).  Then, skim through the following sections:
  - 2.1 The `belongs_to` Association
  - 2.3 The `has_many` Association
  - 2.4 The `has_many :through` Association
  - 2.10 Self Joins
  


### Wednesday

**link to submit in Wednesday's pulse check:** a GitHub repo for aquarium the app you made to practice migrations

1. Finish Part 1 of the [Pet Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/rails-pet-lab).

1. Check out the [Active Record Validations Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html):

  * Read chapter 1 closely.
  * Skim through chapters 2 and 3. Pick three methods from chapter 2 and use them one one or more of the models in your aquarium app (from migrations).


### Thursday

**link to submit in Wednesday's pulse check:** your work from part 1 of the pet lab

1. Finish adding authentication to your pet app. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

1. Review the material that was covered this week:
  * Look at the [weekly objectives checklist](https://gist.github.com/bgveenstra/9a1b733cf308260363bf45e1aff7da7f) for a specific list of the topics we covered.
  * Review the class notes and homework.
  * Read through the Rails guides for any topics that are still stumping you.
  * Come to class with 2 questions that remain from this week's topics.

### Weekend

1. Research a gem for your [lightning talk](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/ruby-lightning-talks)!  Remember to claim the gem in the google doc as soon as you know which gem you want to look into.

1. Work through the [public library app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/public_library_app) twice to build your Rails muscle memory.  You will be building the app at least 2 times, each time gaining skills through repetition. Here's how we want you to work:

  * Start by making a `first-lib-app` project. Move through the instructions and prompts below to build your app.  Time how long it takes you to complete the app.  (Don't do the bonuses on your first run.) Use as many hints as you'd like to check your work and make sure you get through the lab smoothly, and feel free to reference the solution branch for the part you're on. Commit your work along the way and at the conclusion. Once you're finished with the requirements for both parts, edit the README to include your time.
  * Next, create a new `second-lib-app` project. Go through the lab another time, timing yourself again.  Push yourself to peek at the hints and solutions less; you can look at your own first project if you're stuck.  Again, make sure to commit your work.  You should have roughly the same number of commits as you had on your first run. Version control isn't the place to cut corners!  Once you're finished with the requirements for both parts, edit the README to include your time.  After that, try bonuses if you'd like!
