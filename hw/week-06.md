# Week 6

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

<!--

### Tuesday

1. Work through [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0), an interactive introduction to Ruby. The whole tutorial is very useful, but at least do levels 1-4.  _Note: despite what the site says, this will take longer than 15 minutes! Plan to spend an hour on this._
 
1. Get as far as you can with the Ruby Koans listed below in 1-2 hours. See [ruby-koans.md](ruby-koans.md) for an explanation of Ruby Koans.

 - About Asserts - `about_asserts.rb`. This will help you understand how the tests are working, but it's a new concept. Remember, don't get stuck.
 - About True and False - `about_true_and_false.rb`
 - About Nil - `about_nil.rb`
 - About Strings - `about_strings.rb`
 
1. Take about fifteen minutes (total) skimming through the following 3 free books on Ruby. Spend a little time really reading the table of contents (if there is one) and seeing what piques your interest. 

 - http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html
 - http://humblelittlerubybook.com/book/html/index.html
 - http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/
 
 Choose at least one of these books to read more of, and spend at least 30 minutes reading it and making notes.  Skip ahead to the topics that interested you most based on what you remember from JavaScript. You can always go back to previous chapters later!

 > Another great but non-free book is Practical Object Oriented Design (POODR) by Sandi Metz.  For starting out Ruby, you could focus on chapters 1-3.

Use any extra time to go farther with the resources above or check out other resources. Here's a possibility:
- [codewars for Ruby](https://www.codewars.com/?language=ruby)

### Wednesday

1. Do this [OOP reading](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ruby-oop-reading), which works through creating a `Car` class. Write down answers to each of the reflection questions at the bottom of the readme, and **bring your answers in with you tomorrow.**  Tips:
  * If you just read through this, you're not getting the full benefit!  Instead, create a Ruby file to follow along with the code examples and run it every step or two with `ruby your_file_name.rb`.  
  * Try things out! Would it break if I do `car[color]`?  
  * If you're not feeling cars, create an entirely different class following the same examples (plants? phones? baseball players?)!  **Following along in code is a great strategy for reading docs on unfamiliar topics!**  
  * If you want to split this longer reading up a little, good break points are before "Inheritance" and before "Modules".
  

2. If you have time after the reading, finish the <b>first 3 methods in each of the exercises</b> of this [training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/ruby_method_drills). This should only be complete after the OOP Reading. Continue working through these drills when you have time this week. 


### Thursday

1. Read through the [test code](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/go-fish-card-game) from this afternoon's go fish training. Using that example,  some [documentation for the basic structure of an rspec test](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-5/docs/example-groups/basic-structure-describe-it), and the structure of [expectations](http://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs), come up with explanations for the following Rspec methods:  `describe`, `context`, `it`, `expect`.  This should take about **30 minutes**.

1. Write tests for a ________________ class with attributes _____  and _____ and methods _____________ and _______. Make sure your tests document what each part of the class should do!
