# Week 3

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.


### Monday

**Link to submit on tomorrow's pulse check**: the Express routes training.

1. Complete the [afternoon Express routes training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express-routes-training). If you reach three hours of work, [check the solutions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express-routes-training/tree/master/solutions) to catch you up to speed with any difficult portions. Don't work past three hours without reviewing solutions!

1. Looking forward: Read over [mongoose's getting started guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/).
  * Also read the first few sections of Mongoose's [overall guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html), up through the section on creating a model. Write out a brief summary of what a mongoose _schema_ is, what a mongoose _model_ is, and how they're different. **Bring this in tomorrow.**


### Tuesday
**Link to submit on Wednesday night's pulse check**: Mongoose Books App (with sprint 1)

1. [**Finish sprint 1** of the book app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/mongoose-books-app/blob/master/docs/sprint1.md). If you are stuck or have finished work, make sure to check out the [`solution-sprint-1` branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/mongoose-books-app/blob/solution-sprint-1/docs/sprint1.md). Aim to get through one challenge if time allows.
2. **Read ahead**: check out tomorrow's notes on [Mongoose associations](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/mongoose-associations).
3. **Outcomes HW!** Write and share your personal statement and vision about what brought you to this immersive experience and what you're hoping to gain out of it. Include your self-promise about how you are hoping to evolve and grow from this program and why (how is it relevant to your goal and what is your goal?). 

  Ask 3 friends and ex-coworkers for your strengths as well as what are your blind spots (weaknesses). If there were 3 words they would use to describe you, what would they be? List these strengths/weaknesses and 3 words that they would use to describe you.

### Wednesday


**Link to submit on Thursday night's pulse check**: Mongoose Books App (with sprint 2)

1. Continue the Mongoose Books App. You should complete the guided portions of sprints 1 and 2 and attempt the challenges (at least in pseudocode) of sprints 1 and 2. Remember to commit your work frequently, and push your changes to GitHub when you're about to switch to a different branch for a new sprint.

1. Look over the [week 3 learning objectives checklist](https://gist.github.com/bgveenstra/ce17451200bab52b9ee7bebd207c276f). Review them, and pick two learning objectives or questions that you aren't feeling as confident about yet. **Write these down and bring them with you tomorrow.**

1. Get excited! Tomorrow, we have a guest speaker from UXDI in the morning and an alumni panel at lunch!



### Thursday

**Link to submit on Friday night pulse check:** GitHub and Heroku links for Personal API

1. Fill out this [self-assessment form](https://goo.gl/forms/khdfRir9UdseAIBR2).

1. Continue working on your Personal API:
  - Use documentation (like an `/api` route) to show what routes you plan to support with your API.  
  - Create your `/api/profile` route.
  - Set up the schema and model for one resource. Add routes to get all of that resource (`GET /api/things`), get one of that resource (`GET /api/things/:id`), and create one of that resource (`POST /api/things`).
