# Week 3

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.


### Monday

**Link to submit on tomorrow's pulse check**: the Express routes training.

1. Complete the [afternoon Express routes training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express-routes-training). If you reach three hours of work, [check the solutions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/express-routes-training/tree/master/solutions) to catch you up to speed with any difficult portions. Don't work past three hours without reviewing solutions!

1. Looking forward: Read over [mongoose's getting started guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/).
  * Also read the first few sections of Mongoose's [overall guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html), up through the section on creating a model. Write out a brief summary of what a mongoose _schema_ is, what a mongoose _model_ is, and how they're different. **Bring this in tomorrow.**
