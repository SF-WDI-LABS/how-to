# Week 5

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.


### Monday

1. Finish Tunely-Angular sprint 5, through step 3 (deleting a song). Make sure you push your work to GitHub!

1. Get ready for promises! Spend about 40-60 minutes investigating promises with the resources below:
  * Read the first half of  this [cartoon explanation of promises](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html), by Andy Shora. (Stop before "What does this look like in code?")
  * Read the "Description" section of MDN's [JavaScript Promise documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#Description). What an awesome diagram!
  * Watch this 10-minute video on [Angular's `$q` service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2PBVEgMijo).
  * With any remaining time, briefly look over Angular's [`$q` documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) - we'll be using the Deferred API and Promise API (like in the video) instead of `$q` constructor syntax.

1. Based on your research, either answer each of the following questions or write a new, more specific question about the topic:
  * What is a promise?
  * What does it mean for a promise to be pending, fulfilled, resolved, and rejected?
  * How does promise "chaining" work?
  * Draw the life of a promise.  


### Tuesday

1. Review custom directives! Check out [the updated solution code](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/angular-custom-directives/tree/master/solution-code/app) that includes a `<wdi-scoreboard>` directive that takes in an **array** rather than a string. Take 15 minutes to look through these solutions in detail and compare them to your work. Make an effort to follow the setup for the `<wdi-scoreboard>` directive.  Write down any questions to bring to class tomorrow.

1. Spend an hour on the [book app service refactor](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/angular-services-training) that you began this afternoon. Make sure to review [the solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/angular-services-training/tree/solution-31). Additionally, read [the code from the ngResource solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/angular-services-training/tree/ngResource-solution). This is a different approach that Angular provides that drastically reduces the complexity of the code you need to write, but inherently hides a lot of the specifics behind the Angular scenes. A `$resource` is automatically CRUD-able!

1. Review! Prepare a question or question(s) you'd like to cover at the review session Wednesday morning!
